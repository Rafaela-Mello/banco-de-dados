# SQL Database

Some SQL database exercises developed during my college coursework.

These exercises were created as part of my studies in database systems, where I practiced various SQL concepts and techniques through practical assignments.

## üìÅ **Folder structure and topics**:

- `1 - b√°sico & intermedi√°rio`:  
  Basic SQL commands like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, joins, and data manipulation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

- `2 - advanced`:  
  More advanced queries, subqueries, nested `SELECT`, set operations (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`), and performance considerations.

- `3 - procedures & functions`:  
  Creation and use of stored procedures and user-defined functions in SQL.

- `4 - views`:  
  Use of `CREATE VIEW`, `ALTER VIEW`, and how to simplify complex queries using virtual tables.

  Creation and usage of triggers for automating tasks on `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` actions.
